<div id = "about_us"><h3>About Us: </h3> Team Impulse was formed in Spring 2014 to enter the 2014/15 UK CanSat competition.
 Although this had not then been announced, we drafted a document describing aims and analysing the problem 
 from an engineering perspective. We submitted the proposal to our school's engineering department and it was
  accepted; it will go forwards for consideration by the UK branch of the European Space Agency, which organises 
  the challenge.<br/><br/><h3>But what is a CanSat?</h3> A CanSat is a student-built "satellite"
  in the form of a standard soft drinks can - 115mm tall and 66mm in diameter. The CanSat must complete a
   specified mission, in this case the measurement of a set of parameters and autonomous ground navigation 
   to a transmitted location. Whilst collecting these data, it is dropped from between 300 and 1000m;
    it will be launched by rocket, balloon, crane, light aircraft...the sky's the limit! For more information 
    on the CanSat mission proposed, please see <a href = "mission.html">"Mission"</a> above! </div>
